# Shared-Bike-Location-Selection
!
---

In this project, we conducted data mining on Mobike bicycle trip data and various Points of Interest (POI) in Wuhan City, identifying the key influencing factors for shared bicycle travel.

Building upon the Maximum Covering Location Problem (MCLP) model, we utilized a genetic algorithm to optimize the selection of bike deployment locations in Wuhan. 

The optimization results can provide valuable insights to city planners and decision-makers for urban development.
